## Hello 
I am currently interested in distributed systems and multithreading syncronization, including:
### Distributed systems
- Consensus algorithms (Eventually want to write own custom Multi-Decree Paxos)
- Deterministic execution
### Concurrency
+ Some interest in structured concurrency for future perspective
+ Also considering actor-based model (based on fibers for example)
